The Trump administration has announced new deportation plans that will target undocumented immigrants across the country. The executive order calls for increased border security and ICE operations to enforce immigration law. However, civil rights groups including the ACLU have filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of these measures, citing concerns about racial profiling and violations of the Fourth Amendment. The Biden administration has implemented sanctuary policies in some states, but the Trump administration argues that these policies undermine border security and encourage illegal immigration. The debate over immigration reform continues to divide the country, with some advocating for stricter enforcement while others emphasize human rights and constitutional protections.
